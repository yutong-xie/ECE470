# ECE470-Introduction to Robotics-Lab Code

The robotics industry is in a period of rapid growth. ECE470 coversed the fundamentals of modeling, perception, planning, and control, that we need to enter this industry and take advantage of the opportunities presented by it. This course introduced standard modeling and control techniques as well as modern ways of thinking about robotics that are based on methods of optimization and learning.

This repository includes 6 lab work in ECE470 course in Fall 2019, UIUC. 

## Lab Description

### Lab1: Introduction to the UR3 
Lab1 is used to help familiarize with the UR3 robot arm and its industrial programming interface called the teach pendant. Also, I used UR3 to move three stacked blocks from one position to another position using the rules speciÔ¨Åed for the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.

### Lab2: The Tower of Hanoi with ROS
In Lab2, I used the Robot Operating System (ROS) and Python to controll the UR3 and complete the Tower of Hanoi game. 

### Lab3: Camera Sensing and Particle Filter 
In Lab3, I used OpenCV class simpleBlobdetector to find the centroid of orange blobs. Meanwhile, I implemented the particle filter to simulate the measurement of the orange blob/turtle robot's state using the camera to measure the coordinates of the robot's position. 

### Lab4: Forward Kinematics 
In Lab4, I solved the exponential forward kinematic equations for the UR3 and wrote a python function that moved the UR3 to a configuration specified by user.

### Lab5: Inverse Kinematics
In Lab5, I derived and implemented a solution to the inverse kinematics problem for the UR3 robot. Also, I wrote a python function that moved the UR3 to a point in space specified by user. 

### Lab6: Camera Sensing and Integration into the World Frame for a Pick and Place Task
Lab6 required me to integrate all the work done in the first 5 labs with python, ROS, forward and inverse kinematics and OpenCV. I completed the sorting task for different kinds of blocks in this lab.
