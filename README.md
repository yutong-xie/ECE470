The robotics industry is in a period of rapid growth. ECE470 coversed the fundamentals of modeling, perception, planning, and control, that we need to enter this industry and take advantage of the opportunities presented by it. This course introduced standard modeling and control techniques as well as modern ways of thinking about robotics that are based on methods of optimization and learning.

This repository includes 6 lab work in ECE470 course in Fall 2019, UIUC.
